# Agentic AI Python Project

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly Python project for learning and experimenting with agentic AI concepts.

## What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously, make decisions, and pursue goals. This project will help you explore these ideas step by step.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or newer).
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the example script:
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

## Next Steps
- Explore the `main.py` file for a simple agent example.
- Add your own experiments and ideas!

## Project Structure
- `main.py` — Your starting point with a simple agent example.
- `requirements.txt` — List of Python dependencies.
